          <p>aaaaaaaaaaaand we are done with Sinatra.  That was quick.  We did get to jump into rails for the first time.  Chris talked about the old way of blogging, which sounded awfully familiar to what I am doing now.  I probably should have jumped on a blogging site, but I needed the practice on front end.  I am hoping to learn pretty soon how to tie a rails app to this site to make posting easier and start to allow comments for both the people who read this blog.  Or I might just try to tie a blogger page to the site.  Anyway, as you might have noticed there have been a couple updates to the website.  I am using bootstrap for the website now.  I got my first taste of it with the weekend project and it makes things a whole lot easier.</p>

          <p>We jumped back into ruby today.  Specifically we started using Sinatra.  We barely scratched the surface of Sinatra and I could already see how useful it would be.  It seems like a good platform.  It was easy to jump in and use, especially if you understand HTML.  The README explaining how to use it was pretty clear and useful.  Figuring out how to use layout as a default template took me some time, but I got there.  It doesn't seem like we will be spending much time with Frank though since Chris said that this week's weekend lab would be tying ruby on rails to the web page we made this past weekend.  </p>

          <p>Week 3 is complete and in the books.  Things got shaken up a bit and we put ruby on hold and focused on learning Git, HTML, and CSS.  Which should be exciting for anyone reading this because improvements are coming soon on the website.  I think the biggest thing I learned was that CSS is a pain, and Bootstrap is pretty awesome and helpful.  I am excited to get a little more practice on the front end this week though.  For our project this weekend we had to create a website.  We were given a basic structure of the website, but we could have our own content.  I of course chose to make a web page full of Arrested Development references.  I probably spent too much time thinking of references, but you have to find ways to enjoy it, right?  </p>
          <img src="http://i.imgur.com/q08Ds.gif" alt="Arrested Development Chicken Dance Gif"/>
          <p>We also got a visit from <a href="www.john.do">John Saddington</a> who was one of the founders of The Iron Yard among other projects.  He was very interesting and he obviously has a passion for coding and learning.  He spoke oddly enough about building our online presence through blogging.  He recommended a daily blog so starting this week that is something that will probably be happening.  He also answered a lot of our questions about anything we wanted.
          <p>I am not the first person to say this, in fact a few people mentioned this in our class, but the time of John's visit couldn't have been better.  He was open and (extremely) honest about everything we asked about and really encouraged us to step up our games.  We are taking 3 months out of our lives to do this so we need to make sure we focus on doing it well.  The comparison to professional athletes really impacted me because I realized that even though I am putting in a lot of time and effort, but I definitely could be doing more.  No person became great at something accidentally.  </p>

          <p>Iron Pints was held in the facility this week.  Our numbers are growing...We had our bet turnout so far this week.  I appear to be the only scary movie fan in the bunch which is a little disappointing. I did get to watch a couple episodes of Peaky blinders while on the exercise bike and it is really good.  However, Halloween is one of my favorite times of the year so this week may be scary movies during my workouts.  I have not been able to prepare at all with movies or for my costume.   I will probably keep you posted since I don't know what I will write in daily blog.</p>

          <p>We have our first field trip coming up this week.  We are going to Salesforce and they are going to show us around and let us see what a day in the life is like.  I hear it is there halloween party that day.  We may not get to see what normal attire is (I assume we will see some costumes), but I think we will get a lot out of it.  By the way, the thing I may be looking forward to the most is never wearing a tie again until I feel like it.  Actually getting to be comfortable at work will be life changing for me. </p>
          <p>So I will begin daily posts starting tomorrow.  I think I am going to do shorter posts through the week and still do a weekly recap style post. I think it is good to reflect on everything.  </p>

            <p>We are finished with week 2 AKA "Game Week".  We focused on creating objects and methods in Ruby and making different games.  We started out with a dice game called farkle.  Then we created a version of the card game "War".  Then for the weekend project was creating a version of the game "Blackjack".  The games all use the command line to play. </p>
            <img src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/war-games-play-o.gif"/>
            <p>Things are definitely ramping up quickly.  Farkle was the first game.  We had to create dice and and create the rules for a dice game that I had never heard of.  We learned a lot of good tools for creating the games during the first class.  Then we went to work.  On top of using all the tools that we had just learned, it was also good experience of learning a project while I am working on it.  War and Blackjack I am familiar with.  Blackjack I might be too familiar with.</p>
            <p>I spent a lot of time working out possible outcomes for all of the games.  More time than I was originally anticipating.  For War and Blackjack, I think it helped to be familiar with the games.  I could think through most of the outcomes beforehand.  However, it still seemed like every time that I would think I had it figured out I would play the game 5 or 6 times and a new scenerio I hadn't thought of would pop up.  It was frustrating at times and there were a couple of late nights this past week.  Iron Yard provides Tinker Coffee, and many of us in the cohort have taken full advantage of that. </p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hApP9Zg.gif" />
            <p>Overall I am still enjoying the experience A LOT.  That is good because like I said, there were some late nights.  Each error message was initially frustrating, but figuring out a solution was like playing a logic game where I had to walk through all the arguments and try to figure out what the heck I did that caused the problem.  It is still hard to get used to getting a  lot of syntax errors when you start.  When you fix one it just clears the way for the next error in line.  You have to enjoy the small victories though, right? </p>

            <p>I was really glad more people were able to make it to Iron Pints on Friday.  Each Friday we try to have everyone get together without a computer in front of us so we can relax and get to know each other.  Also, we had several people from last cohort able to make it.  All three of them have job offers already! As it turns out, we have a wealth of knowledge in our class on sports, music, and tv shows.  I have to figure out a TV show to get started on this week so I will probably pick up one of the many recommendations.  So far since we have started I have been trying to pick up some new music, but I think this week I am going to reconnect with some of my favorites from high school and college now that I can actually listen to music while I work.   </p>
            <p>I am looking forward to next week.  We have Git,HTML, and CSS coming up.  Going to listen to some Ben Folds and Radiohead and I think my downtime TV show will be Peaky Blinders.  I will keep you posted on how it goes.  Have a great week!</p>

          <p>So this is happening.  I am through week one of <a href="http://www.TheIronYard.com">The Iron Yard</a> Ruby on Rails boot camp in Indianapolis.  I left my job in healthcare, where I have been since I graduated school, to learn a completely new trade.  I have fortunately had a lot a lot of support from my friends and family on this decision.  My parents and my girlfriend encouraged me to make the change if it was something I really wanted to do.  I did put a lot of time and thought into the decision to come to The Iron Yard, but I still feel like I weighed all my options and made the decision to jump off a cliff!</p>
          <img src="http://www.gifbin.com/bin/102012/1351791752_dog_cliff_dive_fetch_pov.gif"/>
          <p>So, what do I think of my decision so far?  So far it has been a lot of fun.  The Iron Yard director and instructor, Emily and Chris respectively, have been awesome in making this a smooth transition.  The whole cohort met on Sunday to meet each other.  We have a good team with a lot of experience in a lot of areas.  PERFECT!  Everyone seems willing to work hard, work together, and learn.  Sunday night we also checked to make sure everyone's computer was set up correctly.  Good thing too because Monday morning we jumped right in.  </p>
          <p>Don't get confused when I say it was smooth transition.  It was smooth, but it was tough.  We started out with a lot of the basics that we had to do for pre-work.  I am not going to lie, I did the prework about 2 weeks before class started and didn't get a lot of chances to practice after I finished.  This stuff is truly use it or lose it material and I had lost a bit of it.  Each day we get three hours of lecture and then Chris sends out our homework.</p>
          <img src="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/53319560.jpg"/>
          <p>That was Monday-Thursay.  Generally with the help of classmates and Chris we figure out how to accomplish all of the homework requirements.  It is exciting to get a problem, start with a blank file, and end up with a completed program that spits out an answer.  Even though I know that my 5 hours of work is going to be done by Chris in 20 minutes tomorrow, I feel like I am able to do it and build on it moving forward. </p>
          <p>Some people who are reading this are probably considering applying to or are about to begin The Iron Yard.  Hopefully you will find this informative.  I only have two bits of advice for you so far:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do the prework!</li>
            <li>Do the #{favorite_swear_word} prework!</li>
          </ol>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do with that list what you want.  Remember I am one week in so what do I know?  This is my first public blog so I am sure I will be updating and changing things as we move forward.  I know the web page is kind of simple, but HTML and CSS are week 3 so things should improve.  I hope you enjoy hte blog and good luck to everyone who is thinking about The Iron Yard!</p>
